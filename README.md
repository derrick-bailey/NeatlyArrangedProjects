# Neatly Arranged Projects (NAP)
## A Solo Developer's Quest for Sanity in Project Management
### Why NAP?

As a developer often constrained by the limitations of available project management tools, I found myself in a predicament. The tools that I needed were either too complex, too simple, cost money, or just not right. Additionally, due to certain restrictions — let's call it a unique interpretation of software usage policy — my options for using existing software were significantly limited, leaving me with very few viable choices. That's when I decided, "Why not build my own?" Thus, *Neatly Arranged Projects* (NAP) was born out of a mix of frustration, a necessity for somewhere to take notes that were less likely to be lost, a passion for organization, and a desire to engage in front-end development for the first time. It's more than just a tool; it's a statement - that sometimes, if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself.

### What's NAP All About?

NAP is a standalone, serverless project management software designed for those who value simplicity, efficiency, and the practical benefits of organized tasks. It's the project management tool I've always wanted but never found. Here's what makes NAP stand out:

- Offline First: No internet? No problem. NAP is designed to work by itself, offline.
- Task Management: Keep track of your tasks without getting lost in unnecessary complexity.
- Note-Taking: Pair your tasks with notes because, let's face it, we all need a place to jot down our genius ideas and organize the million things management wants done.
- Prioritization: Decide what's important and what can wait. NAP won't judge, even if you take a nap.
- Dashboard and Stats: A place to see how much you've accomplished and how many Red Bulls it took to get there.
- React and Node.js: Because modern problems require modern solutions (and I need to modernize my front-end abilities).

### Getting Started (Coming Soon)

Thank you for your interest in Neatly Arranged Projects (NAP)! Please note that NAP is still in development, and we are actively working on preparing it for deployment.

As of now, we're not quite ready to share the executable version of NAP.

Stay tuned.
